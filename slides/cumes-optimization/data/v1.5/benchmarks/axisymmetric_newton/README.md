# Predeclared axisymmetric Newton qualification matrix

These 16 inputs were fixed on September 8, 2026, before running the expanded
qualification. Run every case, including baseline failures, iteration caps and
regressions. The matrix is not a collection selected for Newton successes.

The fixed candidate policy uses forward differences, 32 Krylov vectors and a
32-vector basis, every 100 effective iterations starting at 100, epsilon
`1e-6`, and an acceptance merit ratio of `0.95`. The private solver hook owns
the existing validity, epoch and residual guards. This directory contains
inputs, execution/validation tools and provenance; it does not change
production policy. The completed [qualification report](../../docs/axisymmetric-newton-qualification.md)
and [timing summaries](results-20260908.json) retain all 19 outcomes on both GPUs,
including the separately declared pressure supplement below.

The ordinary solver now exposes this policy as `--newton`; for example,
`build/cumes inputs/solovev.json --newton --output out.bin`. The historical
instrumented runner below still uses the private hook at revision `ade135f`
to reproduce its original timing records. Production behavior and promotion
checks are documented in [ADR-0016](../../docs/adr/0016-opt-in-newton-corrections.md).

All cases are fixed-boundary, stellarator symmetric, axisymmetric and double
precision. Every case retains three configured stages with iteration caps
`[1000, 2000, 2000]` and tolerances `[1e-16, 1e-16, 1e-16]`. Radial grids are
`[5, 11, 55]` except the explicitly named radial-resolution case, which uses
`[5, 11, 99]`. No configured stage is skipped.

The elongation and triangularity labels identify coefficient variations, not
exact geometric elongation or triangularity values. Cases 00–13 share the
cuMES Solovev base and must not be presented as independent physical devices.
In particular, pressure factors of two are local variations of the base;
the upstream analytical case supplies a distinct pressure/current regime.

## Independent fixture provenance and adaptations

The pinned files in `sources/` make generation independent of a local VMEC++
checkout. The upstream inputs were read from VMEC++ tag `v0.7.0`, commit
`335ef66441d82980331d0062ab8d0398eff50818`, in
`src/vmecpp/cpp/vmecpp/test_data/`. Their MIT license is included as
`sources/VMECpp-LICENSE.txt`. `manifest.json` records the original path and
SHA-256 of every source and generated input, and every changed top-level field
with its before/after values.

The circular-tokamak fixture retains its physical inputs. Its original
single-stage controls (`ns=17`, tolerance `1e-20`, cap `3000`) are deliberately
replaced by the common schedule above. The resulting input is an adapted
benchmark, not an untouched upstream regression fixture.

The analytical Solovev fixture retains its full boundary point set, current
profile, `curtor=2823753.28289`, pressure profile/scale, flux, `mpol=13` and
`delt=1.0`. Three explicit adaptations are made:

1. Replace its original `ns=31`, cap `2000`, tolerance `1e-16` schedule by the
   common three-stage controls.
2. Reflect the poloidal coordinate as `theta_old = pi - theta_new`:
   `R_m_new = (-1)^m R_m_old` and
   `Z_m_new = (-1)^(m+1) Z_m_old`. This preserves the geometric boundary point
   set and supplies the orientation used by cuMES's negative-Jacobian contract.
   Independent CPU comparisons should use this same adapted input.
3. Replace its upstream zero R-axis seed by `[4.0]`, a central initial seed.
   This is not an independently converged axis estimate.

That last case is a separate upstream prescribed-current fixture within the
Solovev family, not an unrelated equilibrium family. Its convergence under
the standardized controls is an outcome to record, not assumed in advance.

## Regeneration and runner contract

```sh
python3 benchmarks/axisymmetric_newton/generate.py
python3 benchmarks/axisymmetric_newton/generate.py --check
```

Generation and byte checks perform no equilibrium solves or GPU work.
`manifest.json` contains `cases`, each with an `id` and an `input` path relative
to this directory. `expected` contains the exact configured stage controls and
resolved angular resolution; it is not an expected success result. Runners
must check input hashes, keep baseline and candidate inputs identical, and
retain outcomes for all 16 IDs. Results and timing reports belong outside the
input manifest.

## Finite-pressure supplement: IDs 16–18

After the original 16-case screen, code inspection confirmed that `am` is a
pressure polynomial in SI Pa: `eval_mass_profile` in
`include/cumes/config/profile_functions.hpp` multiplies it by
`DeviceParams<T>::MU_0 * pres_scale`, and
`src/kernels/profiles_impl.cuh` uploads the result to `pres_H`. The original
Solovev central pressure is only 0.125 Pa, so its half/double and profile
variations cover a physically small pressure range.

The following three supplemental cases were declared before their own runs
to address that units-based coverage gap. They were added after observing the
original screen, not presented as part of its initial predeclaration, and
were not selected from timing or convergence results for these new inputs.
Keep all three outcomes, including failures and regressions.

| ID | Pressure polynomial in Pa | Changed field |
|---|---|---|
| 16_solovev_pressure1000_linear | 1000(1-s) | am = [1000, -1000] |
| 17_solovev_pressure5000_linear | 5000(1-s) | am = [5000, -5000] |
| 18_solovev_pressure1000_quadratic | 1000(1-s)^2 | am = [1000, -2000, 1000] |

Only `am` changes from the pinned cuMES Solovev source. Geometry, flux, fixed
iota, axis seed, step, `mpol=6`, angular resolution, grids `[5,11,55]`, caps
`[1000,2000,2000]`, and all three `1e-16` tolerances are retained. The same
fixed Newton policy applies to all three cases.

The separate `pressure_manifest.json` follows the same runner schema and
records the relationship to the original manifest. The original
`manifest.json` and its 16 input files are unchanged. Its SHA-256 remains
`90f28299f35d97d577873620e030f2b88facf9eaa08114ba0aca981f9f90f776`.
Regenerate or check the supplement independently:

```sh
python3 benchmarks/axisymmetric_newton/generate_pressure.py
python3 benchmarks/axisymmetric_newton/generate_pressure.py --check
```

The supplemental generator refuses to proceed if the original manifest or
pinned Solovev source has changed, and writes only IDs 16–18 and the separate
pressure manifest. It performs no solver or GPU work.

## Execute and validate

Use Python 3 with NumPy; the optional VMEC++ HDF5 comparison also requires
`h5py`. First build the private hook in a disposable worktree following the
[Newton reproduction instructions](../../docs/newton-correction-experiments.md#reproduction-and-artifacts).
Initialize submodules recursively before CMake so the build uses the same
B-spline prolongation backend. The unmodified production executable does not
emit the private experiment records required by the runner.

From that worktree, choose unused output directories:

```sh
python3 benchmarks/axisymmetric_newton/run.py --exe build/cumes \
  --manifest benchmarks/axisymmetric_newton/manifest.json \
  --out /tmp/axisym-screen --phase screen --gpu 0 --cpu 8
python3 benchmarks/axisymmetric_newton/run.py --exe build/cumes \
  --manifest benchmarks/axisymmetric_newton/manifest.json \
  --out /tmp/axisym-paired --phase paired --gpu 0 --cpu 8
python3 benchmarks/axisymmetric_newton/run.py --exe build/cumes \
  --manifest benchmarks/axisymmetric_newton/pressure_manifest.json \
  --out /tmp/axisym-pressure-screen --phase screen --gpu 0 --cpu 8
python3 benchmarks/axisymmetric_newton/run.py --exe build/cumes \
  --manifest benchmarks/axisymmetric_newton/pressure_manifest.json \
  --out /tmp/axisym-pressure-paired --phase paired --gpu 0 --cpu 8
```

`paired` defaults to two warmups per variant and five alternating-order pairs.
`--pairs 15` creates the fresh timing follow-up; `--cases ID ...` restricts it
to a declared selection. Use separate directories and keep the original
samples. Failures and malformed diagnostic markers remain recorded. Native
RunReport convergence must agree with the private stage records; all input
hashes, stage controls, three residual components and iteration caps are
checked. `--resume` continues a saved phase without replacing completed runs.

Replay both variants of every converged case with Newton disabled:

```sh
python3 benchmarks/axisymmetric_newton/replay.py --exe build/cumes \
  --manifest benchmarks/axisymmetric_newton/manifest.json \
  --samples /tmp/axisym-paired/samples.json --out /tmp/axisym-replay \
  --gpu 0 --cpu 8
```

Repeat with the pressure manifest and its paired sample directory. The replay
driver derives final-grid inputs only to match checkpoint shape and retains
all physical parameters and the original final tolerance/cap. Replays are
fixed-point diagnostics, not timing workloads. They require convergence at
iteration 1 and exact coefficient bits, except signed zeros in dependent
`m>0` axis coefficients. The raw bit-exact and numerical-exact results remain
visible separately.

`validate.py` checks a saved baseline/candidate pair and optionally its
checkpoints, actual replay outputs and an independently converged VMEC++
HDF5 reference. For example:

```sh
python3 benchmarks/axisymmetric_newton/validate.py \
  --input benchmarks/axisymmetric_newton/inputs/00_solovev_reference.json \
  --baseline /tmp/axisym-paired/00_solovev_reference-pair0-baseline.bin \
  --candidate /tmp/axisym-paired/00_solovev_reference-pair0-newton.bin \
  --baseline-checkpoint /tmp/axisym-paired/00_solovev_reference-pair0-baseline.ckpt \
  --candidate-checkpoint /tmp/axisym-paired/00_solovev_reference-pair0-newton.ckpt \
  --output /tmp/axisym-validation.json
```

The report records exact-state, boundary/parity, geometry validity and input
provenance checks separately from physical differences. R/Z, lambda and B²
differences are diagnostics at equal native coordinates, not a substituted
convergence oracle or an automatically imposed equivalence threshold.
