# cuMES performance

This is the current performance contract: what has been *measured* (never
claimed), on which hardware, and the acceptance policy that governs future
optimization. The dated tuning-session notes have been archived in
`overhaul-history.md`; this document supersedes them for decision-making.

## 1. Measurement harness (§8.1)

`cumes_benchmark_fixed_iteration` runs one radial stage at a config's final
shape (Solovev `ns=55`, W7-X `ns=99`) with `ftol=0` (never converges), discards
a warm-up, and emits JSON: GPU identity, shape, arena/cuFFT bytes, setup vs
solve time, median/p95 wall µs/iter, and an FNV final-state hash. The seed
construction is shared with the CLI via `cumes/state/seed_state.hpp`.

A `cumes::SolverBench` observer samples the single control fence; it is pure
host observability (`bench == nullptr` in production leaves the hot loop
byte-identical). A 2-pass smoke gate (`cumes_benchmark_smoke`) is registered in
CTest.

Production runs also print `device time` for every radial stage and
`total device time` for their sum. These values are measured by CUDA events on
the compute stream around `solver_run`; they exclude stage construction,
publication-field re-evaluation, and file output. In free-boundary runs the
reported interval includes the required host vacuum-coupling gaps between the
prefix and suffix device work, so it represents end-to-end CUDA-stream elapsed
time rather than a sum of kernel durations.

## 2. Steady-state wall time (TITAN Xp, sm_61)

Measured by the fixed-iteration harness with 300 timed passes after 50 warmup
passes, three thermally stable repeats each under `verify-double`:

| shape | median µs/iter | p95 µs/iter | repeats |
| ----- | -------------: | ----------: | ------: |
| Solovev `ns=55` (axisymmetric) | 167.0 / 167.1 / 166.5 | 175.7 / 177.2 / 175.2 | 3 |
| Solovev `ns=55` (generic backend, `CUMES_FORCE_GENERIC=1`) | 179.1 | 194.9 | 1 |
| W7-X `ns=99` (3D, generic toroidal-FFT) | 1757.8 / 1757.7 (first repeat 1874.4: cold-clock ramp, discarded) | 1772.4 / 1772.5 | 3 |

Setup (arena + module construction + profile/table upload, one pass per
stage): ~3.5 ms Solovev / ~3.9 ms W7-X, reported separately from the
iteration time. The axisymmetric backend retains a measured ~7% advantage
over the generic backend on the same shape (167 vs 179 µs/iter).

CUDA Graph re-measurement on the REAL pass DAG (ADR-0003 follow-up,
`cumes_benchmark_graph_realpass`, Solovev `ns=55`): enqueue submission
63.9 µs/pass vs graph launch 9.8 µs/pass (54.2 µs saved), production-pattern
wall 124.0 vs 111.3 µs/pass (12.8 µs ≈ 10% saved), GPU time 125.3 vs
112.9 µs. The real-pass bound is therefore confirmed beneficial on the
submission-bound Solovev workload; the later production decision is recorded
in §3.3.

### 2.1 RTX 4090 optimization measurement (CUDA 12.9, 2026-08-26)

The profiling build used precise double math, NetCDF/HDF5/vacuum disabled, GPU
2, 50 warm-up passes and 300 timed fixed iterations. After a 1000-pass preheat,
six graph-on/graph-off pairs with alternating execution order were used for the
production graph comparison. Medians of the six per-run medians were:

| shape | direct stream | production graph | graph wall reduction |
| ----- | ------------: | ---------------: | -------------------: |
| Solovev `ns=55` | 117.14 µs/iter | 82.33 µs/iter | 29.7% |
| W7-X `ns=99` | 562.10 µs/iter | 534.53 µs/iter | 4.9% |

Relative to the pre-optimization fixed-iteration baselines from the same RTX
session, the final W7-X latency fell from 660.81 to 534.53 µs/iter (19.1%, or
1.236x throughput), and Solovev fell from 115.59 to 82.33 µs/iter (28.8%, or
1.404x throughput). The final-state hashes are identical with graphs enabled
and disabled: W7-X `ce46a7cbe693601a`, Solovev `3c09fd3260b003a8`.

The retained kernel changes are a parallel two-stage Jacobian-statistics
reduction (W7-X kernel time 104.7 to 7.2 µs) and a full-theta inverse-transform
mapping. Register-capping and split forward-reduction prototypes were removed
because they did not clear the 5% acceptance threshold.

Historical hotspot profiles (different sessions; not cross-GPU ratios — see the
blueprint §2) put the W7-X iteration work in the transform accumulation/reduction
(~0.4 ms each on TITAN Xp) and the forward reduction (~0.11 ms on RTX 4090),
with force, geometry, tridiagonal, and residual work smaller — i.e. structural
transform work dominates over generic occupancy tuning, and host synchronization
matters more as kernels shorten.

### 2.2 W7-X fixed-boundary convergence recovery (2026-08-30)

ADR-0007 adds a qualified one-shot recovery of a time step reduced by the
early W7-X transient. It reduces deterministic effective iterations from 2953
to 2711 (8.20%) without changing the per-pass CUDA DAG or its memory use.

A native `sm_89` precise-double build on gervais (RTX 4090, CUDA 12.9,
NetCDF/HDF5 disabled) reproduced both iteration counts and residuals. Six
preheated, alternating A/B measurements pinned to NUMA-local CPU 10 gave
2.0583 s baseline versus 1.9217 s recovery median, a 6.63% end-to-end wall
reduction. Median absolute deviations were 6.1 ms and 7.6 ms. Unlocked GPU
P-state transitions produced isolated slow samples (ranges 2.0510–2.5015 s
and 1.9102–2.5244 s; interpolated p95 2.4893 s and 2.4846 s), so this set does
not by itself establish the performance-policy confidence bound. The exact
8.20% pass reduction, independent-solver state comparison, and frozen
non-target trajectories are the primary acceptance evidence; the diagnostic
opt-out retains direct A/B measurement.

The same policy applied once per multigrid stage reduces W7-X from
`1877 → 1617 → 2011` (5505 total) to `1741 → 1568 → 1635` (4944 total), a
10.19% pass reduction. The final residual triple is FSQR `9.989e-13`, FSQZ
`1.590e-13`, FSQL `5.116e-14`; restarting its checkpoint on the final grid
converges at iteration 1 with the identical triple. Six alternating native
gervais measurements gave 3.3109 s baseline versus 3.0021 s recovery median,
a 9.33% end-to-end reduction (MAD 0.1090 s / 0.2123 s; unlocked-clock ranges
3.1856–3.6662 s / 2.7096–3.5031 s). Solovev remains on its exact established
trajectory because no reduced step survives to its recovery window.

### 2.3 Shaped 3-D cold start (2026-08-30)

ADR-0008 augments the regular `s^(m/2)` boundary-harmonic seed by the factor
`1 + 0.12(1-s)` for fixed-boundary 3-D cold starts. It changes no LCFS value,
preserves the required near-axis order, adds no GPU work, and can be disabled
with `CUMES_SEED_ENVELOPE=0`.

On W7-X single-grid the schedule-specific `0.129` envelope reduces effective
iterations from 2711 to 2465 (9.07%); the earlier common `0.12` value reached
2627. A native `sm_89` gervais run measured 1.334 s of CUDA-stream time at the
new value versus about 1.43 s at `0.12`.
On W7-X multigrid it changes `1741 → 1568 → 1635` (4944 total) to
`1315 → 1559 → 1633` (4507 total), an 8.84% reduction. Combined with the
reference controller baseline, total multigrid passes fall by 18.13%. The
final residual triple is FSQR `9.967e-13`, FSQZ `1.563e-13`, FSQL
`4.956e-14`, and checkpoint replay converges at iteration 1 with the identical
triple. ADR-0008 alone leaves Solovev byte-identical because axisymmetric
seeds are excluded; the later axisymmetric policy is measured separately
below.

Six alternating native gervais runs measured 1.9238 s versus 1.8823 s median
for single-grid (2.16% wall reduction; MAD 6.3/14.8 ms) and 3.4419 s versus
3.2983 s for multigrid (4.17%; MAD 0.331/0.388 s). Unlocked-clock outliers make
these wall measurements noisier than the deterministic pass counts.

### 2.4 Axisymmetric start policy (2026-08-30)

ADR-0009 uses a `-0.07` envelope correction only for coarse fixed-boundary
axisymmetric cold starts and raises the stage-initial descent step according
to whether the state is cold, single-grid, or prolonged. It changes no GPU
kernel, allocation, or per-pass DAG.

Solovev multigrid falls from `251 -> 199 -> 456` (906 passes) to
`235 -> 193 -> 387` (815), a 10.04% reduction, with final FSQR `9.792e-17`.
A final-grid checkpoint replay converges at iteration 1 with a bit-identical
state. A cold single `ns=55` grid falls from 533 to 354 passes (33.58%), with
FSQR `9.835e-17`. W7-X remains exactly on its accepted
`1315 -> 1559 -> 1633` trajectory.

Before adding the lambda predictor, the local TITAN Xp gave 0.445 s versus
0.395 s median multigrid wall time (11.2%), and a native sm_89 gervais build
gave a 3.7% median reduction for the staged-step policy. The final sm_89 build
reproduces the 815/354 pass counts. At this subsecond scale, CUDA process
startup and unlocked P-state outliers dominate, so pass counts are the primary
timing evidence.

### 2.5 Free-boundary cold predictors (2026-08-31)

ADR-0010 extends the host-only cold predictor to free-boundary starts without
changing the vacuum-coupled iteration DAG. A resolution-limited 3-D envelope
reduces CTH-like single-grid from 489 to 384 passes and `15 -> 25` multigrid
from 592 to 563 total passes. The conservative fine-grid predictor reduces
W7-X `ns=51` from 1831 to 1797 passes. The full axisymmetric lambda predictor
reduces Solovev free-boundary from 1047 to 1025 total passes. Final FSQR values
are `9.932e-11`, `9.942e-11`, `9.705e-13`, and `9.822e-15`, respectively.
Adding the qualified `17/14` step on 3-D free-boundary grids through `ns=25`
reduces CTH-like single-grid further to 347 passes and multigrid to
`208 -> 238` (446 total), with final FSQR `9.359e-11` and `9.745e-11`.
Activating the vacuum force at residual sum `3e-2` reduces those trajectories
again to 309 and `198 -> 233` (431 total), with FSQR `9.635e-11` and
`9.885e-11`. W7-X falls from the seeded 1797 to 1733 passes (FSQR
`9.996e-13`), while Solovev remains at 1025.

Seven alternating local TITAN Xp A/B pairs reduced CTH-like multigrid median
wall time from 1.93 s to 1.50 s (22.3%; ranges 1.91--2.01 s and
1.48--1.50 s). Five alternating W7-X pairs reduced the median from 8.37 s to
7.93 s (5.3%; ranges 8.32--8.39 s and 7.85--7.97 s). Pass counts were
identical in every repetition.

### 2.6 Cubic multigrid transfer (2026-08-31)

ADR-0011 replaces two-point linear radial prolongation with a four-point cubic
interpolant in the existing odd-mode regularized coordinate. It changes only
the initial state of a refined stage; force evaluation, descent, convergence,
and the exact axis/LCFS contracts are unchanged.

W7-X changes from `1315 → 1559 → 1633` (4507) to
`1315 → 1443 → 1402` (4160), a 7.70% reduction, with FSQR
`9.986e-13`. Solovev changes from `235 → 193 → 387` (815) to
`235 → 190 → 341` (766), a 6.01% reduction, with FSQR `9.695e-17`.
CTH-like free-boundary changes from `198 → 233` (431) to
`198 → 226` (424), with FSQR `9.920e-11`. Axisymmetric free-boundary
retains linear transfer because cubic regressed its qualified Solovev case
from 1025 to 1045 passes. A final-grid W7-X checkpoint replay converges in one
iteration with the identical residual triple.

### 2.7 Global B-spline fixed-boundary transfer (2026-08-31)

ADR-0012 replaces Catmull-Rom with an interpolating cubic B-spline for
precise-double fixed-boundary continuation. Directly applying the reusable
`InterpolationFunctionTemplate1D<3>` batch on the host improved the initial
state but cost 1.90 ms for W7-X `33 → 66` and 2.94 ms for `66 → 99`, before
PCIe transfers. The production path instead constructs the small linear
interpolation matrix once and applies it to all six spectral families on the
GPU, keeping the state device-resident.

Matrix construction is also removed from the transition's critical path. One
background task builds every scheduled map while the first GPU stage is
running. Over 10,000 warmed-up `-O3 -march=native` calls, gervais measured
median construction times of 36.7 us for W7-X `33 → 66` and 136.5 us for
`66 → 99` (173.3 us total), versus about 462 us for one average W7-X device
iteration. Solovev's two matrices total 9.2 us. The future is therefore ready
long before the first transition in the qualified workloads; only the small
matrix upload and GPU application remain at that boundary.

Relative to Catmull-Rom, W7-X changes from `1315 → 1443 → 1402` (4160) to
`1315 → 1419 → 1372` (4106), with FSQR `9.997e-13`. Solovev changes from
`235 → 190 → 341` (766) to `235 → 193 → 326` (754), with FSQR
`9.973e-17`. The spline is not selected for free-boundary continuation:
CTH-like changed from 424 to 425 passes, and axisymmetric free-boundary
Solovev regressed from 1025 to 1074. Those paths retain their qualified
Catmull-Rom and linear transfers respectively.

## 3. Phase 9 experiments and their outcomes

The exit gate for §8.10–§8.12 was *"measure, then adopt or remove."* Three
experiments were run on the TITAN Xp; one was adopted.

### 3.1 Mixed-float double accumulation — historical adoption (ADR-0001)

The float policy below was superseded by
[ADR-0015](adr/0015-float-only-device-arithmetic.md), which uses float-float
accumulation and float device records. These are the original measurements.

`cumes::NormAccum<T>` (`float → double`, `double → double`) widened the
accumulator of the three control-feeding reductions. **Class A** for the double
build (identity); **Class B** for float, where `test_accumulation.cu` shows a
~20× lower summation error (4.6e1 → 2.3e0 on a 1M-term dynamic-range case). It
does not unlock a lower float `ftol` — the float-state rounding floor dominates.

### 3.2 R/Z vs λ force-kernel split — not adopted (ADR-0002)

The split reduced registers 108 → 82/54 but was **1.20–1.45× slower**: the
force kernel is input-traffic-bound, so the two-kernel split doubled the
geometry/field loads. The prototype has been removed; the conclusion
(§8.10's remaining radial-tile / force+projection fusion ideas trade global
traffic for registers/shared memory and are unlikely to pay) is the durable
result.

### 3.3 CUDA Graph capture — adopted for fixed boundary (ADR-0003)

Empty-kernel microbenchmark: enqueue 1.94 µs/kernel, graph launch 6.43 µs/pass
for 24 kernels → **~40 µs/pass upper-bound saving**. The real-pass
measurement (see §2) confirmed a ~12.8 µs/pass (≈10%) wall saving on Solovev,
with bitwise replay fidelity (`test_cuda_graph`). Modern re-measurement then
showed a 29.7% wall reduction on Solovev and a 4.9% reduction on W7-X. The graph
change therefore clears the adoption threshold on one primary shape while
remaining a non-regressing improvement on the other. Fixed-boundary schedules
are captured lazily and cached by shape. Free-boundary and verification-dump
paths remain direct; `CUMES_DISABLE_CUDA_GRAPHS=1` is the diagnostic opt-out.

### 3.4 Concurrent independent solves — adopted coordination

Meow's cold finite-difference columns can run as independent equilibrium
solves. A two-worker QA diagnostic produced bit-identical target Jacobian
columns and reduced eight-column wall time from 2.801 s to 1.256 s. The same
QH diagnostic exposed a runtime coordination defect: one solver can call the
multigrid stage-boundary `cudaDeviceSynchronize` while another thread is
capturing its fixed-boundary CUDA graph, which CUDA rejects.

The scoped fix is a process-wide host mutex shared only by graph capture and
the multigrid device-wide stage fence. Graph execution and the equilibrium hot
loop remain unlocked, so independent solves can overlap after setup. The
change must preserve the frozen single-solver trajectories, pass the full
cuMES test suite, make the QH concurrent diagnostic deterministic, and show a
positive two-worker throughput result before concurrent solves are treated as
supported. No optimizer or target policy enters cuMES.

The coordination lock passed all 96 verify tests, including a new public-API
regression that runs two complete W7-X multigrid solves concurrently and
requires identical spectral families. The meow diagnostics then produced
bit-identical serial/concurrent Jacobians for both cases. Eight QA columns took
2.823 s serial and 1.247 s with two workers (2.26x); eight QH columns took
2.250 s and 1.025 s (2.20x). These are focused single-Jacobian throughput
measurements, not the repeated end-to-end acceptance statistics required by
§4; end-to-end optimizer qualification remains in meow.

### 3.5 Repeated-solve resource reuse — rejected

Meow now evaluates exact finite-difference Jacobian columns concurrently, but
each column constructs a fresh `EquilibriumSolver`. The facade's implementation
is currently empty and every `solve()` recreates its CUDA stream, multigrid
stage arenas, cuFFT plans, operator stacks, and host snapshot transfers. Before
introducing a session or batch API, expose structured per-call wall timings for
pre-multigrid setup, multigrid execution, final state transfer, and total solve
time. Keep the existing device-pass timer distinct from these host wall times.

Use those timings in meow's QA and QH mode-1 Jacobian workload to determine the
dominant repeated cost. If stream lifetime is measurable, retain one stream per
`EquilibriumSolver` first because it does not alter seeding, stage arithmetic,
or ownership between worker objects. Retaining topology-dependent arenas,
cuFFT plans, and operator stacks is a larger follow-up and is allowed only when
the timing breakdown justifies it. Any reuse must preserve cold-start semantics,
exact serial/concurrent Jacobians, one-solver-per-worker ownership, the frozen
single-solver trajectories, and the 96-test verify suite. End-to-end QA/QH
acceptance remains in meow, while cuMES owns only equilibrium-solve resources
and timings.

The first Release mode-1 measurements put facade setup at only 0.12% of QA
solve wall time and 0.19% of QH. Retaining only the CUDA stream therefore has a
sub-percent ceiling and is rejected. Multigrid wall time accounts for more than
99.7% of each solve, while its existing device-pass timer accounts for roughly
90--92%. Before designing reusable stage workspaces, extend the structured
timings to split aggregate stage setup, iterative solve, final derived-field
capture, teardown, and non-stage multigrid orchestration. This will distinguish
reusable arena/cuFFT construction from required output work and host/device
iteration synchronization. The split is diagnostic only and must sum back to
the already exposed multigrid wall time without changing solver ordering.

The three-run, full-package Release profile closes that follow-up. Averaged
over eight finite-difference solves, QA's 3.1525 s multigrid time split into
0.13690 s stage setup (4.3%), 2.89850 s iteration (91.9%), 0.06035 s final
derived-field capture (1.9%), 0.04174 s teardown (1.3%), and 0.01505 s other
orchestration (0.5%). QH's 2.6627 s split into 0.14062 s setup (5.3%),
2.40979 s iteration (90.5%), 0.06185 s capture (2.3%), 0.03798 s teardown
(1.4%), and 0.01246 s other (0.5%). A persistent topology-keyed stage cache
has only a 5.6%/6.7% absolute QA/QH ceiling even if it removes every setup and
teardown cycle; seeding, uploads, and state publication would remain. It would
also retain roughly 69 MB per worker at the W7-X final grid. That complexity is
not justified by the removable fraction, so resource caching is rejected
without implementation. The structured timing API remains useful
observability for embedding applications.

### 3.6 Transform launch-shape tuning — rejected

With resource lifetime ruled out, optimize only the dominant device path. A
warmed, graph-disabled W7-X `ns=99` fixed-iteration run on the TITAN Xp measured
1.681 ms median wall time per iteration. CUDA-event instrumentation attributed
0.657 ms/pass to inverse transforms and 0.492 ms/pass to forward transforms,
about 68% combined. Hardware-counter collection is unavailable on this host
(`ERR_NVGPUCTRPERM`), so experiments must use repeated alternating runs of the
existing fixed-iteration harness and its bit-identical state hash gate.

First sweep the zeta tile widths of the inverse-accumulate and forward-reduce
kernels independently. Tile width changes only the CUDA launch decomposition:
each output retains its existing serial poloidal accumulation order. Compare
the shipped W7-X and Solovev workloads, retain no public/environment knob, and
adopt a static launch policy only if W7-X clears the 5% gate while Solovev
regresses by at most 2%. If no tile clears that gate, restore the current
launch policy and record the negative result before considering a more invasive
transform algorithm.

The sweep compared forward zeta tiles 4, 6, 8, 12, and 16 and an inverse tile
of 8. Every candidate produced the baseline state hash. Tile 4 was best:
across three preheated alternating runs it reduced the W7-X median from
1.584 ms to 1.528 ms with graphs disabled (3.5%) and from 1.573 ms to 1.518 ms
with production graphs (3.5%). The inverse tile of 8 regressed steady-state
latency. No launch-only variant clears the 5% gate, so the source is restored
to tile 16 and no policy knob is retained.

The next bounded transform experiment targets `inverse_pack_kernel`'s
uncoalesced scratch writes. The current surface-fast thread order coalesces six
coefficient reads but makes each of twelve half-spectrum writes stride by one
FFT row. Compare a toroidal-mode-fast mapping, which coalesces those writes at
the cost of strided coefficient reads, both alone and with the best tile-4
forward launch. It changes no arithmetic or cuFFT layout. Retain it only if the
combined production result clears the same acceptance gate and state hash.

Five alternating production-graph runs rejected that mapping. The pack-only
variant was flat to slightly slower than baseline; the combined variant was
indistinguishable from tile 4 alone. All hashes remained identical. Coalescing
twelve scratch writes does not compensate for making the six state-family
reads surface-strided, so the original mapping is restored.

The next local experiment removes two redundant poloidal-table loads in the
forward reduction. `mcos` and `msin` are exactly `m*cos` and `-m*sin`; deriving
them from the already loaded cosine/sine values trades two cached loads for two
multiplications and may reduce the 72-register kernel's input pressure. First
verify the intermediate transform and final state bitwise, then measure it
alone and with tile 4. Reject both changes if the combined production latency
still misses 5%.

The derived-table variant retained the exact hash but regressed median latency
by about 0.5%; combining it with tile 4 was also slower than tile 4 alone. The
cached poloidal tables are not a limiting input source, so both source changes
are removed.

The single-solver gate does not yet answer whether tile 4 helps meow's actual
four-stream Jacobian throughput: smaller forward-reduction blocks may permit
more useful inter-solver residency than the isolated benchmark exposes. Build
an otherwise identical temporary cuMES package with tile 4, run the controlled
QA/QH mode-1 four-worker Jacobians against baseline, and require identical
matrices and nonlinear iteration counts. Adopt the static tile only if this
embedding workload clears 5% in repeated Release runs without violating the
single-solver regression gate.

The concurrent gate also rejects tile 4. Three alternating Release runs kept
every Jacobian bit-identical and retained exactly 12,171 QA / 8,347 QH
nonlinear iterations. QA's median changed from 0.814 s to 0.801 s (1.6%), while
QH changed from 0.678 s to 0.682 s (0.7% slower). The smaller block therefore
does not improve inter-solver residency enough to matter on the four-worker
TITAN Xp workload. The production tile remains 16.

### 3.7 Near-axisymmetric cold-start shaping — adopted

The mode-1 analytic QA/QH boundaries are three-dimensional but have very small
non-axisymmetric amplitudes; their cold solves still take roughly 1,500 passes.
Use the existing diagnostic `CUMES_SEED_ENVELOPE` override to sweep the radial
boundary-harmonic envelope on the exact center inputs before changing policy.
Record per-stage iterations, final residuals, and state equivalence for both
cases. If one value materially reduces both trajectories, derive any production
selection from a dimensionless boundary-spectrum measure rather than a meow or
target-function special case. The W7-X and axisymmetric frozen trajectories,
checkpoint replay, and the full verify suite remain mandatory gates. Reject the
idea if QA and QH prefer incompatible values or the converged state moves beyond
the accepted equilibrium tolerance.

The sweep selected `-0.10` for fixed-boundary 3-D multigrid starts with
`initial_ns <= 12`; all other paths retain their previous policy. At the
analytic centers, QA changed from `1178 -> 252 -> 118` (1548 total) to
`886 -> 226 -> 100` (1212, 21.7% fewer), and QH changed from
`445 -> 302 -> 361` (1108 total) to `303 -> 293 -> 314` (910, 17.9% fewer).
The converged discrete states are not bit-identical, so this is qualified as a
cold-start branch change rather than a Class-A refactor.

Three four-worker mode-1 Jacobian runs retained exact serial/parallel matrices.
QA's median fell from 0.827 s to 0.658 s (20.4%, 1.256x) and aggregate nonlinear
work fell from 12,171 to 8,829 passes. QH's median changed from 0.693 s to
0.687 s (0.8%) and work from 8,347 to 8,296 passes. Complete exact-Jacobian
mode-1 gates reduced QA work from 242,168 to 208,099 passes (14.1%) with a
0.032% objective change, and QH from 269,787 to 229,078 (15.1%) with a 0.0015%
objective change; both remain within meow's 0.1% quality gate. The standard
Solovev `235 -> 193 -> 326` and W7-X `1315 -> 1419 -> 1372` trajectories remain
unchanged because their start geometries do not enter the new policy branch.

### 3.8 Reuse forward weights and remove unused inverse work (2026-09-08)

Two transform changes reduce repeated work relative to `f0c17f7` (v1.4.1).
The inverse accumulator specializes which constraint output is needed: R/Z
each compute one sum, and lambda computes neither. Basis and derivative-sign
selection remain runtime expressions to preserve the baseline's floating-point
contraction order. The forward transform caches its four weighted poloidal
tables once per stage, using device arithmetic to preserve the original
T-rounded products. The compact W7-X double cache adds 6,144 arena bytes and
removes four multiplications and one weight load per theta contribution.

The cache kernel and its completion fence run only during stage construction.
Per-iteration launch count, graph topology, control fences, controller
decisions, allocation count, and cuFFT workspace are unchanged. No new tuning
option is exposed.

Both architectures use precise double math and native code: TITAN Xp `sm_61`
with CUDA 12.1, and RTX 4090 `sm_89` with CUDA 12.9. With production graphs
enabled and the host pinned to CPU 8, each workload is measured in 16
baseline/candidate pairs with alternating order. Each binary first receives
1,000 warm-up plus 1,000 timed preheat passes; measured runs then use 100
warm-up and 500 timed passes. The table reports medians of per-run median/p95
latencies. Gains are medians of paired percentage reductions, with percentile
95% confidence intervals from 20,000 paired bootstrap resamples; setup and
output are excluded.

| GPU / shape | median baseline → candidate (µs/iter) | p95 baseline → candidate (µs/iter) | paired reduction, 95% CI |
| ----------- | -----------------------------------: | --------------------------------: | ------------------------: |
| TITAN Xp / W7-X `ns=99` | 1584.330 → 1501.220 | 1735.455 → 1652.895 | 5.1905% [5.1588%, 5.2391%] |
| TITAN Xp / Solovev `ns=55` | 124.565 → 124.335 | 193.810 → 193.985 | 0.3346% [-0.1685%, 0.5740%] |
| RTX 4090 / W7-X `ns=99` | 535.545 → 500.770 | 622.805 → 588.895 | 6.4963% [6.4732%, 6.5137%] |
| RTX 4090 / Solovev `ns=55` | 83.950 → 83.935 | 128.340 → 127.200 | 0.0179% [-0.0119%, 0.1303%] |

The W7-X lower confidence bound clears 5% on both GPUs; the Solovev upper
regression bounds are 0.169% and 0.012%. The noise estimate, median absolute
deviation of run medians divided by their median, was 0.337%/0.429%
(baseline/candidate) for Pascal W7-X and 0.265%/0.269% for Pascal Solovev;
Ada gave 0.0065%/0.0070% and 0.0298%/0.0357%, respectively.

Clocks were unlocked. Pascal post-run samples were P0, 1518–1873 MHz core,
5702 MHz memory, 56–68 °C and 69–89 W; W7-X core samples stayed within
1847–1873 MHz. Ada active samples were 2520–2760 MHz core, 10501 MHz memory,
35–46 °C and 55–169 W. Drivers were 580.173.02 and 570.169, respectively.
The Ada build used CUDA 12.9.41/GCC 12.4; its Debian 13 host required six
`noexcept(true)` declaration fixes in a scratch copy of CUDA headers, applied
identically to both builds. No math implementation or compiler precision flag
was changed.

Median stage setup increased from 3.844 to 4.587 ms for Pascal W7-X and
3.422 to 4.184 ms for Pascal Solovev; Ada measured 1.695 to 1.941 ms and
1.791 to 2.221 ms. Output is not part of the fixed-iteration harness.
The W7-X arena grows from 69,318,752 to 69,324,896 bytes, and Solovev from
704,456 to 706,376 bytes. cuFFT workspace remains 4,105,728/63,424 bytes
for Pascal W7-X/Solovev and zero for both Ada cases. The graph DAG and scratch
layouts are unchanged. Pascal fused R/Z inverse register use falls from 56 to
48, while lambda uses 64; forward reduction remains at 72. Ada uses 48/56/72
registers for these kernels. Neither build introduces spills.

The weighted tables add a measured 1.59% W7-X reduction beyond the inverse
change on RTX 4090. Every fixed-window final-state hash matches its baseline.
All 65 verify and 66 float tests pass, including the float FP64-instruction
audit and compensated W7-X cold-start/replay regression. Complete default
multigrid dump manifests are byte-identical on both architectures: 241
Solovev files and 472 W7-X files. The diagnostic opt-outs also retain the
frozen trajectories. Pascal Fourier memcheck/initcheck/racecheck/synccheck,
compensated-geometry memcheck/initcheck, and Ada Fourier memcheck pass.
These are comparisons within each architecture, preserving the respective
baseline's cuFFT results.

These percentages qualify steady-iteration latency. Full-process Ada timings
were too noisy for a separate end-to-end speedup claim: Nsight located a
653 ms outlier in the first `cudaMalloc`, and an A/A comparison of the same
baseline executable through a symlink reproduced the order-dependent startup
delays. Full graph solves still produced identical checkpoints.

The broader inverse specialization was rejected: making the basis compile-time
changed which product the compiler fused in `c0*sin + c1*cos` and the R
poloidal derivative, failing first-pass bitwise comparisons. Restricting
specialization to unused constraint work restored Class A. Capturing the
control/axis/boundary copies in the graph and omitting unused transform timing
events were also tested and removed because they showed no reliable gain.
They are excluded from the reported candidate.

The subsequent [block-correction experiments](block-correction-experiments.md)
retain every configured multigrid stage and tolerance. Lambda inner solves
and a coupled radial R/Z prototype did not qualify a further default speedup;
the report records their complete-solve results and numerical validation.

The remaining [fully coupled Newton–Krylov](newton-correction-experiments.md)
and [FAS coarse correction](coarse-correction-experiments.md) proposals were
also tested through all original multigrid stages and tolerances. Newton's
selected Solovev variant reduced scoped solver time by 10.05% on Pascal and
4.16% on Ada in five paired runs; its Ada lower confidence bound was 2.28%,
below the adoption gate. W7-X showed no reliable benefit across architectures.
FAS increased solver wall time in both full-solve screens. Reproducible private
patches and diagnostics are retained; these experiments do not change defaults.

The [broader axisymmetric study](axisymmetric-newton-qualification.md) tests
that same Newton policy on 19 inputs and both GPUs. All configured solves
converge. The adapted prescribed-current case improves scoped solver time by
19.21% on TITAN Xp and 14.51% on RTX 4090, while fresh measurements confirm
Ada regressions for circular, low-resolution and one finite-pressure case.
Axisymmetry alone therefore does not qualify a default policy. The report
retains every initial pair, uncertainty-selected follow-up and solution check.
The qualified axisymmetric forward32 policy is available through the explicit
`--newton` flag; [ADR-0016](adr/0016-opt-in-newton-corrections.md) records its
promotion checks. The default remains unchanged.

### 3.9 Free-boundary vacuum kernels and transfers (2026-09-09)

The [free-boundary qualification](free-boundary-performance.md) measures
complete configured Solovev, CTH and W7-X solves against `bcdd3da` on both GPUs.
Parallel axisymmetric source terms retain the original ordered sum; smaller
blocks distribute small singular RHS systems across the GPU; pinned bridge
copies join existing fences. The split-graph experiment was discarded.

Seven paired runs give solver-interval reductions of 37.01% / 29.69% for
precomputed-grid Solovev and 6.77% / 23.70% for positive-flux W7-X on TITAN Xp /
RTX 4090. Coefficients, fields and numerical stage reports remain bit identical
within each architecture. All configured stages, tolerances, caps and vacuum
update decisions are preserved. The report includes confidence intervals,
process-wall results, retained failures, float limitations and raw data.

## 4. Acceptance policy (verification.md §7)

A performance-motivated change is accepted only when, on one named target
workload, the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval shows an improvement
`> max(5%, measured noise floor)`, while the upper bound on the other primary
workload's regression is `<= 2%` — unless a separately approved correctness or
memory benefit justifies it. Requirements:

- repeated thermally stable warm runs; report median, p95, CI, clocks, and the
  noise floor (never a single timing);
- setup and output reported separately from effective-iteration time;
- compared on the legacy Pascal target *and* one modern architecture;
- peak arena/cuFFT/graph memory growth beyond an agreed baseline is rejected
  unless the measured benefit justifies it;
- the old backend is retained until the new one passes both numerical and
  performance gates.

**Current two-architecture validation:** §3.8 qualifies the current transform
changes against the same `f0c17f7` source baseline on TITAN Xp and RTX 4090,
using each machine's identical baseline/candidate toolchain. The fixed-boundary
double W7-X and Solovev iteration-latency gates and numerical comparisons pass
on both architectures. This does not turn historical timings into same-code
measurements or extend the timing claim to free-boundary or float solves.

Equivalence class precedes any timing claim: Class A requires bitwise equality;
Class B requires per-operator ULP bounds and identical controller decisions;
Class C requires residual/validity qualification, independent comparisons with
differences reported, and a written ADR.

## 5. Decision records and historical inputs

- `overhaul-history.md` archives the TITAN Xp optimization pass and RTX
  4090 profiling session. Their measurements are historical comparison inputs,
  not acceptance goldens.
- `docs/adr/0001..0003` — the decisions behind §3.
